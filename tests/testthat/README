To run tests for this package, create a folder in 'tests/testthat' called 'testData' and a folder inside it called 'dictionary'


Run 'makingFakeData.R', in the 'tests' folder, updating 'database_dir' to your database location.
  This will save test data to '.../tests/testthat/testData' and will save dictionary to '.../tests/testthat/testData/dictionary' unless the directories are changed.
DO NOT COMMIT THIS FOLDER TO YOUR GIT REPOSITORY.

The test files will load the data in the testData folder and run the tests on that.
